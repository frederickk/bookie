**Manage bookmarks natively**

The bookmarks within Bookie are simply Chrome bookmarks stored in a folder called "Bookie". You can manage the entries for Bookie within the menu itself (via edit and add options) or simply through the native Chrome bookmarks UI.

**Add related notes**

You can also add additional notes to accompany each category, these notes are stored within local storage and are accessible by you. But they will sync across all devices when logged into Chrome. Formatting of notes is handled with markdown, simply clicking on the text box exposes the underlying markdown.

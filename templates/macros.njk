+++ Homer
**Homer** was the author of the *[Iliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad "Iliad")* and the *[Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey "Odyssey")*, the two epic poems that are the foundational works of [ancient Greek literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_literature "Ancient Greek literature").

The *Iliad* is set during the [Trojan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War "Trojan War"), the ten-year siege of the city of [Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy "Troy") by a coalition of [Mycenaean Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece "Mycenaean Greece") kingdoms. It focuses on a quarrel between King [Agamemnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agamemnon "Agamemnon") and the warrior [Achilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles "Achilles") lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war. The *Odyssey* focuses on the ten-year journey home of [Odysseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus "Odysseus"), king of [Ithaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca "Ithaca"), after the fall of Troy. Many [accounts of Homer's life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_accounts_of_Homer "Ancient accounts of Homer") circulated in [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity), the most widespread being that he was a blind [bard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard "Bard") from [Ionia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionia "Ionia"), a region of central coastal [Anatolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia") in present-day [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey"). Modern scholars consider these accounts [legendary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend "Legend").

The [Homeric Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Question "Homeric Question") -- concerning by whom, when, where and under what circumstances the *Iliad* and *Odyssey* were composed -- continues to be debated. Modern scholarship considers that the two works were written by different authors. It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late eighth or early seventh century BC.

The poems are in [Homeric Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Greek "Homeric Greek"), also known as Epic Greek, a [literary language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_language "Literary language") which shows a mixture of features of the [Ionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_Greek "Ionic Greek") and [Aeolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolic_Greek "Aeolic Greek") dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic. Most researchers believe that the poems were originally [transmitted orally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition "Oral tradition"). From [antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity") until the present day, the influence of Homeric epic on [Western civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture") has been great, inspiring many of its most famous works of literature, music, art and film. The Homeric epics were the greatest influence on ancient Greek culture and education; to [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato"), Homer was simply the one who "has taught Greece" -- *ten Hellada pepaideuken*.

+++ The Odyssey
Tell me, O Muse, of the man of many devices, who wandered full many ways after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy. Many were the men whose cities he saw and whose mind he learned, aye, and many the woes he suffered in his heart upon the sea, seeking to win his own life and the return of his comrades. Yet even so he saved not his comrades, though he desired it sore, for through their own blind folly they perished—fools, who devoured the kine of Helios Hyperion; but he took from them the day of their returning. Of these things, goddess, daughter of Zeus, beginning where thou wilt, tell thou even unto us.

Now all the rest, as many as had escaped sheer destruction, were at home, safe from both war and sea, but Odysseus alone, filled with longing for his return and for his wife, did the queenly nymph Calypso, that bright goddess, keep back in her hollow caves, yearning that he should be her husband. But when, as the seasons revolved, the year came in which the gods had ordained that he should return home to Ithaca, not even there was he free from toils, even among his own folk. And all the gods pitied him save Poseidon; but he continued to rage unceasingly against godlike Odysseus until at length he reached his own land.

Howbeit Poseidon had gone among the far-off Ethiopians—the Ethiopians who dwell sundered in twain, the farthermost of men, some where Hyperion sets and some where he rises, there to receive a hecatomb of bulls and rams, and there he was taking his joy, sitting at the feast; but the other gods were gathered together in the halls of Olympian Zeus. Among them the father of gods and men was first to speak, for in his heart he thought of noble Aegisthus, whom far-famed Orestes, Agamemnon's son, had slain. Thinking on him he spoke among the immortals, and said: “Look you now, how ready mortals are to blame the gods. It is from us, they say, that evils come, but they even of themselves, through their own blind folly, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained.

Even as now Aegisthus, beyond that which was ordained, took to himself the wedded wife of the son of Atreus, and slew him on his return, though well he knew of sheer destruction, seeing that we spake to him before, sending Hermes, the keen-sighted Argeiphontes,1 that he should neither slay the man nor woo his wife; for from Orestes shall come vengeance for the son of Atreus when once he has come to manhood and longs for his own land. So Hermes spoke, but for all his good intent he prevailed not upon the heart of Aegisthus; and now he has paid the full price of all.

+++ The Illiad
RAGE:
               Sing, Goddess, Achilles' rage,
Black and murderous, that cost the Greeks
Incalculable pain, pitched countless souls
Of heroes into Hades' dark,
And left their bodies to rot as feasts
For dogs and birds, as Zeus' will was done.
    Begin with the clash between Agamemnon--
The Greek warlord--and godlike Achilles.

   Which of the immortals set these two
At each other's throats?
                                    Apollo
Zeus' son and Leto's, offended
By the warlord. Agamemnon had dishonored
Chryses, Apollo's priest, so the god
Struck the Greek camp with plague,
And the soldiers were dying of it.
